        <h2 class = "heading"> History </h2>

            <p>In the first ever all ireland senior hurling championship in 1887, Galway were runner up, losing <br>
            to tipperary to the final. They didnt get into another final till 1923, where they defeated limrick <br>
            to recieve their first ever whin in the all ireland championship. Since then galway struggled to get a win such as being <br>
            runner ups in 1924, 1925, 1928, etc. It had been 35 years since their only triumph. Like many counties <br>
            that had previously experienced success before enduring a lengthy spell without titles, Galway  <br>
            became the subject of rumours of a curse. To this day, Galway have won the all ireland hurling final  <br>
            17 times, most recent being in 2017. </p>
